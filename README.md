# City Crawlers

This is the source code for [City Crawlers](https://wardergrip.itch.io/city-crawlers) which is a submission for the [Kenney Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2023). The theme of the game jam was **Exploration**. The unique constraint of this particular jam was that all art (except audio, animations and fonts) must come from Kenney.

## Game description
Explore the city and survive hordes of zombies while you complete quests for other survivors to ensure your survival.
The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible. Game time is paused when you enter a house. NPCs can be found in houses which can give you items in return of other items. You can find items by exploring the city. You'll need the items from NPCs to heal and get other goodies.
